# Google Meet & AI/ML Integration on Video Calling App
#### Task: UI Component Creation and Integration with Google Meet and AI/ML Solution

Can only be used on **Android** devices.

**Thank you so much to [Hitesh Choudhary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l691BQ-RGc) for helping me set up for React Native, and thank you to [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) for teaching me the basics along with the documentation for setup on this README.md.**

## Step 1: Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/aliciaha311/video-call-app
2. Install dependencies.

### Packages Used
* `React` - The core library for building the user interface.
* `react-native` - The core library that includes components and APIs for building the app.
   - Imported components: `View`, `Text`, `Button`, `StyleSheet`, `Image`, `SafeAreaView`, `StatusBar`, `ScrollView`, `Dimensions`
* `react-native-orientation-locker` - Library used to maintain portrait mode regardless of how the mobile device is rotated.
   - `Orientation`


## Step 2: Start the Application

Open up your _Android Emulator_ using Android Studio. The emulator used to test this program is on the _Pixel 5 API 34_.

Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ app:

```bash
npx react-native run-android 
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio.

## Notes
### My First React Native Project
This is my first project developed using React Native on my own! As I have only done a few lessons on React Native up until this point, this project marks a crucial part of my journey into the world of mobile app development.

### Learning Goals
- **React Native Components**: Understanding the core components and how to utilize them effectively.
   - I believe I have a solid understanding of the basics of React Native components, including how to use core components effectively to build user interfaces.
- **State Management**: Exploring different state management solutions for better app scalability.
- **API Integration**: Learning how to connect my app with external APIs to enhance functionality.

### Future Enhancements
My immediate goal for this project is to implement landscape orientation. I plan to research and experiment with the necessary adjustments to ensure a smooth user experience in both portrait and landscape modes.

### Next Steps
- Researching and experimenting with landscape orientation implementation.
- Exploring advanced React Native features and libraries.
- Continuously refining my coding skills through practice and project development.

Thank you for checking out my project! I welcome any feedback or suggestions as I continue to grow and improve my skills in React Native.
